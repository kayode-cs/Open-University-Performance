# OPEN-UNIVERSITY-PERFORMANCE #
**Student Performance &amp; Dropout Risk Insight** 

# 🔍 Project Overview
This project leverages the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) to analyze student performance data in order to uncover key behavioral, regional, and socio-economic factors influencing academic outcomes, with the aim of identifying at-risk student groups and informing strategies to improve retention and success rates. 

# 📂 Dataset
**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rocki37/open-university-learning-analytics-dataset/discussion?sort=hotness()

**Size:** 31,483 (Rows)

**Columns:** code_module, code_presentation	,id_student,	gender, region, highest_education, imd_band, age_band, num_of_prev_attempts, studied_credits, disability, final_result


## **📊 Key Insights**
- What is the overall distribution of final academic outcomes?
- How do behavioral factors (previous attempts) impact academic success?
- Does gender and disability status influence academic outcomes?
- What is the relationship between deprivation index and student withdrawal rates?
- How does academic performance vary by region?

### **1.  Final Result Distribution**
This shows the overall breakdown of students by outcome: Withdrawn, Fail, Pass, and Distinction.
It quickly highlights where most students end up (e.g., high withdrawal rates) and points to areas needing intervention (like dropout prevention programs).
### 2. **Behavioral Factors and Academic Success Correlation**
This compares the number of previous attempts across different final outcomes.
It shows that students with more attempts are more likely to withdraw or fail, helping to identify students at risk early based on their academic history.
### 3. **Final Result by Region**
This visualizes academic outcomes across different geographical regions.
It uncovers regional differences in performance, allowing decision-makers to target support services to struggling regions like Scotland and London Region.
### 4. **Disability Status on Academic Performance**
These compares studied credits for male and female students, distinguishing between those with and without disabilities.
It highlights the participation and potential performance gaps between disabled and non-disabled students, guiding inclusive education policies.
### 5. **Withdrawn Students by Deprivation Level (IMD Band)**
This tracks the number of studied credits for withdrawn students based on deprivation levels.
It links socio-economic background to withdrawal rates, helping institutions prioritize financial aid, mentoring, and support for students from deprived areas.
